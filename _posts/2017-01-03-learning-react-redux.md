So I've been wanting to learn a useful framework for a while now, and React has always been on my radar.
At the end of last year I decided to cut the cord and start following a free course recommended by a friend, [this one](https://fullstackreact.io/30-days-of-react).

I'm currently on day 20 of 30 and oh boy let me tell you it's harder than I thought it would be. We've barely made a functional 2 page app with no content and we already have over 7 separate javascript files that all hook into each other.

At the start I was very pleased with the course, it took off very slowly and explained everything in detail. It's still an amazing course (it's free after all, cut them some slack). But I did notice some of the code snippets have typo's in them, or wrong variable names etc.

The biggest step up would probably be integrating Redux. It was pretty hard for me to grasp the concept of organizing data using Redux and hooking it into our React components. But I think I more or less get it now.

All in all I can't complain about the course, I'll keep updating this post the more I advance.
I'm also planning on putting my freshly learned skills to the test by building my own React application.
I came up with the not-so-original idea of a search engine that uses several API's to find the newest hottest posts for a search.
