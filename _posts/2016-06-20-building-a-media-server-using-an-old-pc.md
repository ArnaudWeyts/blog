A week ago I ordered computer parts on Amazon & built a completely new PC for my dad. His old PC had become so slow, it was unbearable.
It didn't have an SSD, so that explains a lot. But to be honest it wasn't just the HDD. His computer was just really, really old. His motherboard was still running legacy power, and his processor was pretty much done for too. So I decided to build him a new one.

I still had some parts laying around from my old computer that weren't completely outdated (Intel Core Duo E8400, a decent motherboard). So I decided to use the case and HDD from my dad's ancient computer and my old parts to create a Frankenstein media server. Turns out old computers with decent enough processors make freaking great media servers. I re-pasted the processor, cleaned it out a bit and it was up and running in minutes.

I'll go through the steps to make a simple home file server (accessible by Windows, Linux & macOS), that also allows for remote torrent downloading and can also be used to stream media on devices using Plex server.

# Choosing your operating system
This simple setup is most likely also possible on a Windows server OS, or any Linux server distribution, but I chose for **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS**, it's convenient, and Ubuntu is usually a tad easier to set up than other distributions like Arch Linux. 16.04 got released only months ago, and it's a long term support version, so that will also come in handy.
